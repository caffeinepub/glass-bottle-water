  "summary": "The diff implements the vast majority of requirements. Backend actor in main.mo covers REQ-1 and REQ-2. Frontend covers product catalog (REQ-3), checkout/cart flow (REQ-4), admin dashboard (REQ-5), consistent aqua/teal theme (REQ-6), and hero/bottle images from assets/generated (REQ-7). One minor gap: the OrderManagement component does not expose filtering orders by status in the UI (REQ-2 AC), though listing and status update are present. The admin mode toggle protects the dashboard. No significant hallucinated features were found.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "All orders can be listed and filtered by status.",
      "reason": "The OrderManagement component lists all orders and allows updating status, but there is no visible filter/tab UI to filter orders by status (pending/confirmed/delivered/cancelled). The backend supports filtering but no frontend filter control is implemented in OrderManagement.tsx.",
